Here's a detailed breakdown of the project to develop a predictive ANN model for forecasting department-wide sales and analyzing markdown impact during holiday weeks:

**Project Overview**

Title: ANN Predictive Modeling of Retail Sales and Markdown Impact using Streamlit and AWS Deployment with TensorFlow

**Domain**: Retail Analytics

**Objective**:

Develop a predictive Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to forecast sales for each store's department over the next year.
Analyze the impact of markdowns on sales, particularly during holiday weeks, and provide actionable insights for optimizing markdown strategies and inventory management.

**Problem Statement**
The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can:

**Forecast Sales:**

Predict department-wide sales for 45 retail stores over the next year, taking into account various factors such as seasonality, holidays, and markdowns.
Markdown Analysis: Understand the effect of markdowns on sales during holiday weeks versus non-holiday weeks and recommend optimal markdown strategies to maximize revenue.
****Project Approach

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**

Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.
Convert date formats to appropriate data types for time series analysis.
Normalize/standardize features using techniques like StandardScaler to ensure the model performs optimally.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Analyze trends in sales data to identify seasonality, holiday impacts, and patterns.
Explore relationships between markdowns, holidays, and sales performance.
Visualize feature distributions and sales over time to understand underlying patterns.

**Feature Engineering**

Lag Features: Create lagged versions of sales data to capture trends and seasonality.
Holiday Features: Generate binary indicators for holidays and other special events.
Markdown Interaction: Create features that capture interactions between markdowns and holidays to analyze their combined effect on sales.

**Modeling**

**Time Series Models:** Consider time-series forecasting methods for comparison.

**Deep Learning Models (ANN):**

Develop an ANN model using TensorFlow with different architectures, such as multiple hidden layers, varying activation functions, and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
Train the model on historical sales data, incorporating markdowns and holiday features.**
Markdown Impact Analysis:** Use statistical techniques to assess the impact of markdowns on sales during holiday weeks versus non-holiday weeks.

**Model Evaluation**

Use evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² to assess the model's accuracy.
Specifically evaluate the model’s performance on holiday weeks versus non-holiday weeks to understand the impact of markdowns.

**Insights and Recommendations**

Provide actionable insights for markdown optimization, such as ideal discount levels, timing, and product categories for markdowns during holiday weeks.
Offer suggestions for inventory management based on predicted sales volumes to reduce stockouts or overstock situations.

**Deployment**

Deploy the trained model on AWS using Streamlit to create an interactive web app.
Allow users to input various factors (e.g., markdown percentages, holiday indicators) to get real-time sales forecasts.

**Project Evaluation Metrics

Metrics to be used:
MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
Performance analysis on holiday weeks vs. non-holiday weeks
Business impact of recommendations (e.g., increased revenue, reduced costs)
